"Contemplative Space 04" showcases Sahong's most experimental approach within this series. Here, she introduces subtle textural elements that create shadow and depth, adding a sculptural quality to the work while maintaining its essentially two-dimensional nature.

The composition is more dynamic than earlier works in the series, with diagonal movements and layered marks creating a sense of energy contained within the contemplative framework. This tension between movement and stillness is characteristic of Sahong's mature work.

Working with traditional materials but a contemporary sensibility, Sahong creates a bridge between Korean artistic heritage and international contemporary practice. The work invites viewers to slow down and enter a space of quiet reflection, offering respite from the visual noise of contemporary life.
