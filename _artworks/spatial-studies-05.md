"Spatial Studies 05" is part of Min hea jung soo's ongoing investigation into the relationships between architectural space and abstract form. This work combines painting with collage elements, creating layers of visual information that suggest the complexity of urban environments.

Jung Soo's approach is characterized by a sophisticated understanding of composition and spatial relationships. The work's square format emphasizes its all-over composition, with no dominant focal point but rather a network of relationships that activate the entire surface.

The palette of grays, whites, and occasional color accents creates an urban sensibility while maintaining the work's abstract character. There's an architectural quality to the composition?�a sense of structure and order?�but also moments of spontaneity and gesture that humanize the geometric framework.

This piece exemplifies Jung Soo's ability to create works that are both visually compelling and intellectually engaging, bridging the gap between pure abstraction and architectural reference.
