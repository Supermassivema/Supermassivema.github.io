"Geometric Meditation 01" marks an important development in Stephen Jones's ongoing exploration of geometric abstraction. This striking work demonstrates Jones's ability to create visual complexity through the interplay of simple geometric forms and carefully considered color relationships.

The composition features bold, hard-edged shapes that create a dynamic sense of space and movement. Jones's precise execution and refined color palette?�dominated by deep blues, warm oranges, and neutral grays?�create a sophisticated visual experience that rewards extended viewing.

What distinguishes Jones's geometric work from purely formalist abstraction is the emotional resonance he achieves through his careful orchestration of form and color. The work invites meditation and contemplation, suggesting that geometric abstraction can be both intellectually rigorous and emotionally engaging.
