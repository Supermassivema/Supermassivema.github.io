"Luminous Forms 01" exemplifies Debbie Doye's mastery of color and light. This stunning work features her signature use of translucent layers that create an almost ethereal quality, as if the painting itself is emanating light from within.

The composition balances geometric precision with organic flow, creating a sense of movement that draws the viewer's eye across the canvas. Doye's careful layering technique builds depth and complexity, with each viewing revealing new subtleties and relationships between forms.

The color palette of soft blues, warm ochres, and luminous whites creates a contemplative atmosphere, inviting quiet reflection. This piece represents Doye's ongoing exploration of abstraction as a means of capturing emotional and spiritual experiences.
