The second work in Sahong's "Contemplative Space" series continues her investigation of emptiness and presence. In this piece, the negative space becomes as important as the marked areas, creating a dynamic tension that activates the entire surface.

Sahong's marks are both assertive and restrained?�confident gestures that nonetheless maintain a sense of quietude and contemplation. The work exemplifies the Korean aesthetic principle of "yeo-baek," or remaining white, where empty space is understood not as absence but as potential and presence.

The subtle color palette of ink blacks, earth tones, and soft grays creates a harmonious whole that feels both ancient and contemporary. This piece demonstrates Sahong's ability to create works that honor traditional Korean artistic philosophy while speaking powerfully to contemporary viewers.
