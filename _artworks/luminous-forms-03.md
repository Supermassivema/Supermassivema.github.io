The third work in this acclaimed series showcases Doye's most ambitious exploration of scale and luminosity. This larger canvas allows for even more complex layering and creates an immersive viewing experience.

The composition suggests landscape without being literal?�horizons hint at themselves through bands of color, while vertical forms evoke standing stones or architectural elements. Yet the work remains resolutely abstract, its power coming from pure visual relationships rather than representational content.

Doye's masterful use of translucent glazes creates an almost atmospheric quality, as if we are looking through veils of colored light. This work was highly sought after and sold during the opening weekend of the "Abstract Reflections" exhibition.
