The second work in Doye's "Luminous Forms" series continues her exploration of light and transparency. This piece features a more dynamic composition with bold gestural marks that intersect with delicate, translucent washes.

The interplay between opaque and transparent elements creates a sense of depth and mystery. Doye's intuitive approach to mark-making results in a composition that feels both spontaneous and carefully considered, balancing energy with contemplation.

Rich earth tones are punctuated by unexpected flashes of bright color, creating visual rhythms that guide the viewer's experience of the work. This piece demonstrates Doye's ability to create complex visual experiences within a seemingly simple compositional framework.
