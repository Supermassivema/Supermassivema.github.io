"Abstract Reflections" brings together two accomplished contemporary artists whose work explores the boundaries of abstraction and representation. This exhibition showcases Debbie Doye's luminous abstract compositions alongside Geum Sahong's contemplative mixed-media works, creating a dialogue between different approaches to abstract expression.

Doye's paintings in this exhibition feature her signature use of layered colors and translucent forms, creating works that seem to shift and change as viewers move through the gallery space. Her intuitive approach to composition results in pieces that feel both spontaneous and carefully considered, inviting extended contemplation.

Geum Sahong's contributions to the exhibition explore the intersection of traditional Korean aesthetics and contemporary abstract practice. Using a combination of traditional materials and modern techniques, Sahong creates works that bridge cultural and temporal boundaries, offering fresh perspectives on abstraction's possibilities.

The exhibition features eighteen works total, including several pieces created specifically for this show. The curatorial approach emphasizes the conversation between the artists' distinct visual languages, highlighting both their individual strengths and the surprising resonances that emerge when their works are placed in dialogue.

"Abstract Reflections" opens June 20th, 2026, with artist talks, curator tours, and a published exhibition catalogue.
