## Biography

Geum Sahong is a contemporary Korean artist whose paintings exist at the intersection of cultural heritage and modern artistic exploration. Based in Seoul, Sahong's work reflects a deep engagement with both traditional Korean painting techniques and contemporary conceptual frameworks.

Trained in traditional Eastern painting methods, Sahong brings a refined sensitivity to composition, color, and mark-making that echoes centuries of artistic practice. Yet their work is unmistakably contemporary, addressing themes of globalization, cultural identity, and the persistence of memory in an increasingly interconnected world.

Sahong's paintings often feature subtle gradations of color, delicate layering, and a masterful use of negative space?”all hallmarks of traditional Asian aesthetics applied to contemporary subject matter. There is a quiet intensity to the work, an invitation to slow down and observe closely. Each piece rewards sustained attention, revealing complexities that aren't immediately apparent.

Interesting artworks often feature subtle gradations of color, delicate layering, and a masterful use of negative space—all hallmarks of traditional Asian aesthetics applied to contemporary subject matter.

Their work explores the concept of \"in-between-ness\"—the space between past and present, East and West, tradition and innovation. This liminal quality makes Sahong's paintings particularly resonant for viewers navigating their own experiences of cultural hybridity and change.
