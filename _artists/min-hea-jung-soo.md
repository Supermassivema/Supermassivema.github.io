Min Hea Jung Soo is a Korean-Australian artist working at the intersection of photography, digital media, and installation. Based in Sydney, Min Hea's practice explores the complexities of cultural identity, personal memory, and the ways we construct and reconstruct narratives about ourselves and our communities.

Born in Korea and raised in Australia, Min Hea brings a nuanced perspective to questions of belonging, hybridity, and the immigrant experience. Their work often layers imagery, text, and found materials to create rich visual compositions that function both as personal narratives and broader cultural commentary.

Min Hea's photographic work ranges from documentary-style portraiture to highly constructed, conceptual imagery. They are particularly interested in how photography?봡espite its association with objective truth?봧s always an act of interpretation and storytelling. By manipulating, layering, and recontextualizing photographic images, Min Hea reveals the subjective nature of visual representation.

## Artistic Practice

Min Hea's practice is deeply research-based. Projects often begin with extensive investigation into family archives, community histories, or cultural traditions. This archival material becomes raw material for artistic transformation?봯hotographs are scanned, digitally manipulated, reprinted, and sometimes further altered through physical processes like painting, collage, or installation.

The resulting works exist in multiple registers simultaneously. They are personal family stories and universal human experiences. They are specifically Korean and broadly contemporary. They honor tradition while questioning it. This multiplicity reflects Min Hea's own experience navigating multiple cultural contexts and speaks to the experiences of many people living in increasingly globalized, hybrid cultures.

Digital technology plays a crucial role, not as a gimmick but as a meaningful tool for exploring themes of transformation, memory, and the constructed nature of identity. Min Hea uses digital processes to mirror the ways we continually reinterpret and reconstruct our understanding of the past.
