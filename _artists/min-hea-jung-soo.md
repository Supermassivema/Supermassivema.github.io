## Biography

Min Hea Jung Soo is a Korean-Australian artist working at the intersection of photography, digital media, and installation. Based in Inverell, Min Hea's practice explores the complexities of cultural identity, personal memory, and the ways we construct and reconstruct narratives about ourselves and our communities.

Born in Korea and raised in Australia, Min Hea brings a nuanced perspective to questions of belonging, hybridity, and the immigrant experience. Their work often layers imagery, text, and found materials to create rich visual compositions that function both as personal narratives and broader cultural commentary.

Min Hea's photographic work ranges from documentary-style portraiture to highly constructed, conceptual imagery. They are particularly interested in how photography—despite its association with objective truth—is always an act of interpretation and storytelling.

## Artistic Practice

Min Hea's practice is deeply research-based. Projects often begin with extensive investigation into family archives, community histories, or cultural traditions. This archival material becomes raw material for artistic transformation—photographs are scanned, digitally manipulated, reprinted, and sometimes further altered through physical processes like painting, collage, or installation.

The resulting works exist in multiple registers simultaneously. They are personal family stories and universal human experiences. They are specifically Korean and broadly contemporary. They honor tradition while questioning it. This multiplicity reflects Min Hea's own experience navigating multiple cultural contexts and speaks to the experiences of many people living in increasingly globalized, hybrid cultures.

## Recognition

Min Hea Jung Soo has exhibited widely in Australia and internationally. Their work has been featured in group exhibitions exploring themes of cultural identity, diaspora, and contemporary Asian-Australian art. Min Hea has received grants and residencies supporting their practice and is represented in several public and private collections.
