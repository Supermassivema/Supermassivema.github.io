Based in the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, Debbie is a ceramic sculptor whose practice is deeply informed by her connection to landscape, material, and light.

Working primarily with raw clay, she investigates the relationship between solidity and transience through sculptural form. Her process embraces the inherent qualities of the material, allowing hand-worked marks to remain visible. These tactile surfaces emphasise the integrity of the clay while inviting shifting light to activate each piece.

Debbie has exhibited extensively throughout the Northern Tablelands, including in Inverell, Glen Innes, Lismore, and Tamworth. Her practice continues to reflect an ongoing exploration of earth-derived form and the subtle presence of shadow within sculptural space.

## Exhibition Statement — Chasing Shadows

Chasing Shadows explores the quiet tension between permanence and impermanence. Working with clay — a material drawn directly from the earth — Debbie creates forms that feel grounded and substantial, yet are only fully realised through light.

In this body of work, shadow is not incidental but integral. As light shifts, edges soften, silhouettes extend, and negative space becomes active. The sculptures are never fixed; they evolve throughout the day, inviting viewers to slow down and notice subtle movement within stillness.

Each piece embodies both presence and absence — solid clay holding an echo of something fleeting. Chasing Shadows is an exploration of form in transition and of the quiet moments where light, earth, and time converge.
