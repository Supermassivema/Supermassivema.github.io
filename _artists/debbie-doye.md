---

Debbie Doye is a Sydney-based abstract artist whose work celebrates the interplay of color, texture, and form. Working primarily in mixed media, Doye creates layered compositions that invite viewers into contemplative spaces filled with energy and movement.

Her practice is rooted in intuitive mark-making and a deep exploration of materiality. Each piece evolves organically, with layers of paint, collage, and mixed media building upon one another to create rich, tactile surfaces. Doye's color palette ranges from bold, saturated hues to subtle, nuanced tones, reflecting her interest in emotional expression through chromatic relationships.

Drawing inspiration from both natural landscapes and urban environments, Doye's abstractions exist in a liminal space between representation and pure form. Her works don't depict specific places or objects but rather capture the essence of experience?봳he feeling of light shifting across a surface, the energy of a bustling street, the quiet contemplation of solitude.

## Artistic Approach

Doye's creative process begins with spontaneity and experimentation. She often starts with bold gestural marks, allowing the work to guide her decisions as it develops. This intuitive approach results in compositions that feel both dynamic and harmonious, with each element finding its natural place within the whole.

Texture plays a crucial role in her work. By incorporating various materials and techniques?봣rom thick impasto to delicate washes, from collaged elements to scraped surfaces?봁oye creates visual and physical depth that rewards close viewing. Her surfaces invite touch, even as they remain purely visual experiences.

## Recognition

Doye's work has been featured in private collections throughout Australia and internationally. She continues to develop her practice through ongoing experimentation with materials and color theory.
