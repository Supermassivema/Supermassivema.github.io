## Biography

Stephen Jones is a British-Australian artist whose sculptural practice investigates the fundamental relationships between form, material, and space. Based in Melbourne, Jones creates works that range from intimate table-top sculptures to large-scale installations that transform architectural environments.

With a background in both fine arts and architecture, Jones brings a unique understanding of spatial dynamics to his practice. His works often play with perception, creating visual phenomena that shift as viewers move around them. Through careful manipulation of materials?봫etal, wood, stone, and found objects?봋ones creates pieces that feel both timeless and thoroughly contemporary.

There is a meditative quality to Jones's work. His sculptures don't shout for attention but rather invite contemplation. Clean lines, balanced compositions, and a restrained material palette create objects that feel inevitable, as though they couldn't exist in any other form. Yet despite this apparent simplicity, there is tremendous complexity in how his pieces interact with light, shadow, and surrounding space.

## Sculptural Philosophy

Jones approaches sculpture as a language of essential forms. He is interested in reduction rather than elaboration?봲tripping away the unnecessary to reveal the core visual and conceptual idea. This minimalist sensibility connects his work to traditions ranging from Japanese aesthetics to European modernism, yet his pieces maintain a distinct contemporary voice.

Material choice is paramount in Jones's practice. He works extensively with metal?봲teel, bronze, aluminum?봞ppreciating both their structural properties and their ability to capture and reflect light. Wood provides warmth and organic contrast, while stone grounds his compositions with weight and permanence. Found objects occasionally enter his work, their histories and patinas adding layers of meaning.

## Process and Making

Jones's studio practice combines traditional craftsmanship with contemporary fabrication techniques. He works directly with materials, allowing their properties to inform the evolution of each piece. Welding, carving, casting, and assemblage all play roles in his process, depending on what the work demands.

Scale varies significantly across his practice. Some pieces are deliberately intimate, meant to be encountered closely in domestic or gallery settings. Others are architectural in ambition, designed to transform how we experience larger spaces. Regardless of scale, precision and attention to detail remain constant.
