      <p>
        44BYION STUDIO curates exceptional contemporary art that exists in spaces of transition and possibility.
        We seek works that invite viewers to pause, to question, to see differently—art that functions as
        a threshold between familiar and unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our program emphasizes artists working at cultural crossroads: those synthesizing Eastern and Western
        traditions, bridging analog and digital practices, or exploring the tensions between minimalism and
        materiality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based in Sydney's vibrant Surry Hills, we are committed to making contemporary art accessible while
        maintaining the highest curatorial standards.

          aesthetic experience.

          deepens understanding without prescribing interpretation. We trust our visitors' intelligence
          and curiosity.

      <p>
        44BYION STUDIO was founded in 2024 by curator and art historian Dr. Alexandra Kim, whose doctoral
        research explored cross-cultural aesthetic dialogues in contemporary Asian-Australian art. Having
        worked with institutions including the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia and Art Gallery of NSW,
        Alex recognized the need for a independent studio space focused specifically on art existing at
        cultural and conceptual thresholds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name "Liminal" reflects our core interest: art that exists in transitional spaces, between
        categories, at productive edges. The Latin root <em>limen</em> means threshold—that space of
        potential and transformation where change becomes possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Located in Surry Hills, one of Sydney's most creative neighborhoods, we opened our doors with a
        commitment to presenting ambitious contemporary art in an intimate, contemplative setting. Our
        program includes four to six curated exhibitions annually, alongside an ongoing salon-style
        collection display.
