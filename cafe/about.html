  <div class="our-story">
    <h2>How We Began</h2>
    <p>
      Ember & Hearth started with a simple idea: to create a gathering place where exceptional coffee meets genuine hospitality. A space where the ritual of your morning brew feels special, where brunch with friends becomes a memory, and where strangers become regulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      We opened our doors with a commitment to craft coffee sourced directly from growers, seasonal food made from scratch, and an atmosphere that invites you to stay awhile. From the beginning, our goal has been to create more than just a cafe—we wanted to build a neighborhood hearth where everyone belongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, that vision continues to guide everything we do. Whether you're here for a quick flat white or settling in for a long brunch, we want Ember & Hearth to feel like your place.

    <h2>What We Believe</h2>
    <p>
      We believe coffee is a ritual worth slowing down for. That food tastes better when it's made from scratch. That spaces should feel like home, not just look like it. That genuine hospitality means making everyone feel welcome, whether you're a regular or walking in for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every decision we make—from the beans we source to the music we play—is guided by a simple question: Would this make us want to stay?

  <div class="the-space">
    <h2>A Place to Linger</h2>
    <p>
      Natural light pours through large windows. Tables are made from reclaimed timber. Plants hang in corners. The space is designed to feel lived-in, warm, and real—because the best cafes aren't showrooms. They're second living rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've created different zones for different moods: communal tables for conversation, cozy booths for quiet moments, bar seating for watching the magic happen. Whether you're working on your laptop, catching up with friends, or simply enjoying a moment alone with your coffee, there's a spot for you.
