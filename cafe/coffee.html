    <h2>The Story Behind Your Cup</h2>
    <p>
      Great coffee is a journey that starts thousands of miles away, in the hands of farmers who tend their crops with care and intention. At Ember & Hearth, we're committed to sourcing beans that not only taste exceptional but also support the people who grow them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work directly with coffee growers through long-term partnerships, ensuring fair prices and sustainable practices. Every bean is traceable to its origin, and we can tell you exactly where your coffee comes from, who grew it, and how it was processed.
